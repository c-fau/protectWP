          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://publicaccess.eastherts.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=RLWL2CGL00T00&activeTab=summary">The proposal</a> is for a 24 MW (Mega Watt) solar farm as well as the supporting infrastructure, of which a 15MW lithium ion battery array is included.
             The proposed location is 3 fields (roughly 52 acres of farmland) 1 mile north of Hertford between Bengeo and Ware.</p>
             <p>
              The site is accessible via 2 roads, one from the direction of Ware and the other from Bengo. This means that both areas will see an uplift in industrial traffic during and after the construction of the solar farm.
              
             </p>
             <p>
              In addition to this, the access from Ware goes past a Primary and Secondary school, increasing traffic during and surrounding school hours.

            <h1 id="visibility">Visibility of The Site</h1>
            <p>The site is highly visible from Bengeo and along the B158. See pictures (left)<br>
               The first two pictures are taken from the B158, The third is a view from Bengeo, and the last is a picture of some properties which are in direct line of sight to the proposed area. The visible area is similar to that of picture 3 for these properties.</p>
               <p>
                As you can see the location is  visible from the surrounding area, on top of this these panels are expected to have a maximum height of 4.1 meters from ground level making it hugely unlikely that they will be disguised by trees or bushes.

              <h1 id="wildlife">Wildlife In The Area</h1>
              <p>The proposed area is home to many different and protected species! Bats are very present in the area, as are badgers and muntjac deer.
                 Red Kites can always be seen in the skies, and even Lesser seen species such as Fallow deer have also been spotted on the fields of the
                  proposed site.</p>
                 <p>
                  As you can imagine the fences detailed in the screening documents would pose a major obstruction to the wildlife blocking their routes
                   and forcing them away from the area.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The impact to bats and kites cannot be ignored, bats often mistake large flat surfaces for sources of water, this causes the bats to fly into the panels and sadly die. And kites having their 
                  hunting ground obstructed with huge amounts of cover cannot be overlooked.
